# OptimisationTeachingKit

This teaching kit contains a complete exercise book about many discrete optimisation topics: 

  * Julia programming
  * mixed-integer linear optimisation: 
    * modelling 
    * comparing formulations
    * solving by branch and bound
    * solving by cutting planes
    * solving by Lagrangian relaxation
  * combinatorial optimisation: 
    * dynamic algorithms
    * constraint programming
  * polynomially-solvable problems: 
    * flows
    * matchings
    
It is distributed as a [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/) file (using branches to distinguish the exercises, hints for the students, and complete worked-out solutions), with figures (in the `book` folder) and Julia source code (in the `examples_julia` folder). [Have a look at the current version!](https://github.com/dourouc05/OptimisationTeachingKit/releases)

## How to contribute? 

Any kind of contribution is welcome. For example: 

  * new exercises (at least including the final solution, preferrably completely worked out), both for existing and new topics
  * new code examples (in Julia or any other programming language)
  * rewording, links towards literature and other references
  
For now, the book is useable, but can be perfected in many places.
